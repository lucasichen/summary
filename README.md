Welcome to Summary.io, where you'll be able to watch videos such as lectures and even take notes directly from the videos transcription. This web application was created using React.js, Node.js, and utilizing AssebmlyAI.

<summary>Inspiration</summary>
<br>
Summary.io was inspired by how much virtual education has changed over the past years due to COVID-19. Due to classes now being recorded, students can easily watch their classes whenever they want. But end up having to pause the video to copy notes or write down the teacher's comments.

## How it was supposed to work
The plan was to allow you can upload an mp4 or mp3 file and watch it along with the transcript. You can also upload your slides to be annotated, and even drag and drop the transcription onto the slides. Once done, you can export your annotated slides.
